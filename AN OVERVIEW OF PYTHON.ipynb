    "### **Disadvantages of Python Programming Language.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted language, which can result in slower execution compared to compiled languages like C or C++. However, performance-critical sections can be optimized using libraries or by implementing critical sections in a lower-level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):**\n",
    "- Python's GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, limiting the potential for true parallelism in certain scenarios, especially for CPU-bound tasks. However, Python provides mechanisms to work around this limitation, such as multiprocessing or using libraries designed for parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mobile Application Development:**\n",
    "- While Python can be used for mobile app development using frameworks like Kivy or BeeWare, it is not as commonly used as languages like Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android."
