- **What is Python?**

Python is an interpreted, high-level language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.It is dynamically typed and garbage collected. 
Python programs have the extension .py and can be run from the command line by typing python file_name.py.

Probably its most noticeable characteristic is its use of significant white space to delimit code blocks, instead of the more popular {} symbols.
End-of-line semicolons (;) are optional and usually not used in Python. Python becomes the best solution in many domains from web applications, data analysis, data science, machine learning, and AI.

- Different methods for executing Python code and programs. 
--- 

**3 - GETTING STARTED: Python fundamentals.**. 
- Python as a programming language , programming techniques supported python programming language and it’s programming language category.
- Variables, defining and using variables in python programming language.  
- Comments, keywords, identifiers, rules to follow when defining identifiers  literals. 
- Built-in functions in python programming language like print( … )
- Operators in python programming language.
- PEP8 rules and standards in Python programming language.
 
---
**Project 1:** This project tests the mastery of Python basics, these include, what python is, uses and applications of python programming language, types of programming techniques that python supports, variables, keywords, identifiers,  literals, type conversion, operators and ability to execute an run python program and code on different environment.
